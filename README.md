# Coursera-Deep-Learning-Specialization-JupyterLab-Answers

This repository contains all JupyterLab homework answers that I have finished for deep learning specialization by Coursera.
Even though there are other people's answers somewhere online, but I found those are either outdated or missing some parts. 
Some are even wrong answers, which they don't have the expected answers with coursera. 

Hope this JupyterLab answer will help you learn this specialization along the way.
